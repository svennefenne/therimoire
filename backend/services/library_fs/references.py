"""Rows that point at a library record but no foreign key will clean up.

Deleting a book, map, token, or audio row leaves behind everything that
referenced it by id. Nothing in the schema removes those rows for us:

* ``Bookmark.book_id`` and ``AudiobookProgress.audiobook_id`` are real foreign
  keys with no ``ondelete``, and connections run ``PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON``
  (``models/db.py``), so deleting a bookmarked book or an audiobook someone
  has playback progress on *raises IntegrityError* rather than cascading.
* ``Favorite``, ``ResourceTag``, and ``CampaignResource`` are polymorphic —
  ``item_type``/``resource_type`` plus a bare id — so they carry no foreign key
  at all and their rows are simply orphaned.
* ``book_search`` is an FTS5 virtual table holding a soft ``book_id``.

This module is the single place that knows the full list. It was previously
open-coded in two places that each knew a different subset: the cleanup sweep in
``routers/maintenance/_helpers`` (books only) and migration 0024. The media
cleanup loops knew none of it, so every cleanup run orphaned favorites and tags
for missing maps, tokens, and audio.
