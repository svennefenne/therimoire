"""Path resolution, containment, and sidecar identification.

The foundation layer every other module in this package builds on. Two rules
live here and are not re-derived anywhere else: a caller-supplied path is only
ever turned into a real one by :func:`safe_join` (which resolves both sides
before the containment check), and the library root is deliberately *not*
symlink-resolved, so the paths produced here match the ``filepath`` values the
scanner stored.
