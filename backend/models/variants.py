"""The vocabulary of variant kinds shared by models, services, and routers.

A *variant* is a second file of the same thing: a printer-friendly cut of a
rulebook, a form-fillable character sheet, a gridless copy of a battle map, an
older version superseded by errata. It is a real file the user owns and can
open, so it keeps its own row and its own id — it is only hidden from browsing,
counts, and search so one book does not occupy five shelf slots.

Kept in its own module so ``models`` and ``services`` can both import it without
either depending on the other.
"""

# Why a closed set and not a free-text field: the kind drives the label the UI
# shows in the version picker and the badge, and a closed set keeps those
# translatable. ``variant_label`` next to it stays free text for the specifics
# ("v1.0.1").
#
# Note that the paired kinds are two entries rather than one: in a spreads /
# single-page pair each file carries its own kind, and the same holds for
# gridded / gridless. A single "spreads-or-single" kind could not say which
# member you were looking at.
#
# The vocabulary is *scoped by collection*, because most kinds only mean
# something for one of them: a gridless token or a form-fillable audio track is
# not a distinction a user can make, and offering it only invites mis-filing.
# Anything that applies everywhere lives in _UNIVERSAL; the rest is listed
# against the collections it actually describes.

#   universal-vtt - a .dd2vtt/.uvtt export carrying walls and lights, the same
#                   map as the flat image beside it.
#   video         - an animated cut of a still map.
#   image         - the still cut of an animated one; the counterpart to
#                   ``video``, for the same reason gridded/gridless are a pair.
