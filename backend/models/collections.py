"""The media collections, described once.

A *collection* is one of the indexed libraries — books, maps, tokens, audio,
models. Before this module each feature that had to work "for every collection"
carried its own hand-written table of them: a dict of models in the bulk
service, another in the duplicates job, another for dismissals, a third spelling
in the tag service, plus a scattering of ``("book", "map", "token", "audio")``
tuples and four-armed ``if/elif`` chains. Adding a fifth collection meant
finding all of them, and three failed *silently* when missed — an unlisted type
dropped its tags, orphaned its favourites on delete, or refused a scoped rescan.

So the collections are named here, once, and the tables that used to be written
out by hand are derived from this one. Adding a collection is a row in
``COLLECTIONS`` plus the things a row cannot express (a router package, a
frontend view); it is no longer a hunt.

Singular vs plural
------------------
Both spellings are load-bearing and neither is derivable from the other in
general (``audio`` is its own plural). The *singular* is the discriminator
stored in rows — ``resource_tags.resource_type``, ``favorites.item_type``,
``campaign_resources.resource_type``, ``VARIANT_KINDS_BY_TYPE``. The *section*
is the plural: the top-level library folder, the scan-scope prefix, and the key
in stats payloads. ``singular_for`` / ``section_for`` translate between them, in
place of the six independent re-derivations that existed before — including one
that spelled it ``section[:-1]``.

This module deliberately imports only models. It sits below services and routers
so anything may import it without a cycle.
