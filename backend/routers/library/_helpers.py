# 300s. Streaming made the renderer fast enough to raise MAX_TRIANGLES to 20M,
# and a mesh that size measures ~57s on a fast desktop — so 180s looked like
# three times the worst case. It is not, because the multiplier that matters is
# not safety margin against the mesh, it is the speed ratio against the *host*.
# Grimoire's typical home is a NAS or a mini-PC, frequently 3-5x slower per core
# than a development machine, and this rasteriser is single-threaded pure Python
# with no SIMD to fall back on. At 4x slower the largest allowed mesh needs
# ~230s and a real 716 MB / 14M-triangle mini needs ~160s, both of which 180s
# cuts off part-way.
#
# The symptom is the silent one — no preview, no error, and the flag cleared so
# it is never retried — which is exactly what makes an over-tight budget worse
# than a slow scan. This is a guard against a pathological file, not a
# performance target: nothing waits on it, it runs after the fast phases are
# done, and a healthy mesh never comes close to it. Buying headroom for slow
# hardware costs nothing on fast hardware.
