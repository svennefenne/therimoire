"""Library filesystem scan.

``scan_library`` walks the library tree and registers books, maps, tokens, and
audio in the database, then applies ``tags.json`` folder tags and reconciles the
missing-file flags. This module is now just the orchestrator: it resolves the
scope, counts the work, builds the shared ``_ScanContext``, and runs the phases
in order. The phases themselves live in focused siblings:

* ``_context`` — ``_ScanContext``, the walk filters, and the file counter
* ``systems``  — resolving ``books/`` folders into ``GameSystem`` rows
* ``books``    — the books walk, containers, and ``Book`` registration
* ``media``    — maps, tokens, and audio
* ``reconcile``— missing-file sweep, move detection, system pruning, sidecars

Phase order is load-bearing and documented at each call below.

Import-compatibility: the phase helpers are re-imported into this module's
namespace, so ``patch("backend.indexer.scan.<name>")`` and attribute access on
``backend.indexer.scan`` keep working exactly as before the split.
