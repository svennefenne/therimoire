"""Registering maps, tokens, and audio.

Maps and tokens differ only in their extension set, model, and thumbnail size,
so both run through ``_scan_media``; audio gets its own walk because it carries
embedded tags and folder artwork rather than a rendered thumbnail. All three are
flat walks — unlike books there is no container or category structure above the
file, so the folder path becomes the collection name and nothing more.

Patch-safety: ``generate_thumbnail`` is stubbed by tests via
``patch("backend.indexer.…")`` and so is called through the package namespace
(``indexer.NAME``).
