"""The post-walk sweep: missing files, moves, vanished systems, sidecars.

Everything here runs after the collection phases, when the scan knows the full
set of paths that exist on disk. That ordering is what makes move detection
possible: a row whose file is gone and a row inserted by this same scan with
matching content are the two halves of one move, and only a completed walk can
pair them (issue #284). ``ctx.inserted_ids`` is the guard — a *pre-existing*
row is a file that did not move, however well its bytes match.

``_prune_vanished_systems`` is deliberately gated by its caller on a full books
walk, since ``seen_system_ids`` is only populated by that walk.

    ``GameSystem`` behind forever — visible in the library with no way to remove

    * this scan never walked to it (so no folder maps to it any more),
    * it owns no content of any kind, including through child systems, and
    * a user has not adapted it (renamed it, or given it a description, cover,
      or other metadata), since that signals a row worth keeping even when the
